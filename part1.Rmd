## Derivatives in R
Latex = pronounced "la tech", use single or double $ to have it knit as an equation

Find the derivative of $$f(x) = 5x^2$$

```{r}
ex_1 <- expression(5 * x ^ 2)

# whenever you have an undefined variable, use expression function (r doesn't need to know variable to store as value)

my_derivative <- deriv(ex_1, "x")
my_derivative

# I want to find slope at x = 2.8

x <- 2.8
eval(my_derivative)
```


Find the slope of $g(z) = 2z^3-10.5z^2+4.1$

```{r}
gz <- expression(2 * z ^ 3 - 10.5 * z ^ 2 + 4.1)

dg_dz <- D(gz, 'z')
dg_dz

# Let's evaluate the slope over a range of values
z <- seq(from = -3, to = 4, by = 0.5)

# Evaluate it!
eval(dg_dz)
```

Git = software for version control
Github = a way to use Git and collaborate
